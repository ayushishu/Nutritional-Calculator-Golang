# Nutritional Calculator in GoLang ðŸŒ±ðŸ”¢

## Overview

Welcome to the Nutritional Calculator project, a GoLang application designed to help you track essential nutrients in your diet. This project leverages GoLang's simplicity and efficiency to provide a robust solution for monitoring energy, sodium, sugar, fiber, and protein levels in various types of food.

## Concepts Covered

- **Slices**
- **If-Else Statements**
- **Structs**
- **Loops/Range**
- And more!

## Features

- **Energy Levels**: Track the energy content of your food.
- **Sodium Levels**: Monitor the sodium intake for a healthier lifestyle.
- **Sugar Levels**: Keep an eye on sugar content in your diet.
- **Fiber Levels**: Ensure you're meeting your daily fiber requirements.
- **Protein Levels**: Track protein intake for muscle health.

## Learning in Public

This project is part of my public learning journey with GoLang. I encourage collaboration, feedback, and discussions to foster a vibrant coding community. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or share your thoughts!

## Code Quality

I take pride in maintaining clean and modular code. The project demonstrates the use of well-defined types, clear structuring, and efficient functions. Contributions and suggestions for code quality improvements are always welcome.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `main.go` file to calculate the nutritional score based on the provided sample data.

```bash
go run main.go
```
## Code Structure

The project is structured with a clear separation of concerns and modular components. Here's an overview of the main files and their roles:

- **`main.go`**: Entry point of the application. It initializes the necessary data and invokes the Nutritional Calculator to calculate the nutritional score based on the provided sample data.

- **`nutritional_calculator.go`**: This file contains the implementation of the Nutritional Calculator logic. It defines methods for calculating points based on energy, sugar, saturated fatty acids, sodium, fruits, fiber, and protein levels. The `GetNutritionalScore` function computes the overall nutritional score.

- **`types.go`**: This file defines custom types used throughout the project. These types include EnergyKJ, SugerGram, SaturatedFattyAcids, SodiumMilliGram, FruitsPercent, FibreGram, ProteinGram, and NutritionalData.

The project follows a modular structure, allowing for easy maintenance, testing, and future enhancements. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of the application, promoting code organization and readability.

## Why GoLang?

GoLang's simplicity and performance make it an excellent choice for building efficient applications. The clean syntax and built-in concurrency support contribute to the development of robust solutions like this Nutritional Calculator. GoLang's speed and efficiency are particularly advantageous for projects that demand high-performance execution.
